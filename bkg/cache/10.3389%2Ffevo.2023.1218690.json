This study examined mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in cytochrome <jats:italic>c<\/jats:italic> oxidase subunit 1 (COI) for 26 insect species\u2014Coleoptera (9), Hymenoptera (9), and Lepidoptera (8)\u2014introduced to the Nearctic from the Palearctic. A total of 6,302 barcode records were retrieved from BOLD (boldsystems.org) to compare sequence diversity between the native and introduced range. As expected, genetic variation averaged nearly an order of magnitude lower in introduced populations (2.19 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> substitutions per nucleotide) than in the native range (1.48 \u00d710<jats:sup>\u22124<\/jats:sup> substitutions per nucleotide). Nonsynonymous and synonymous changes had a similar incidence in the introduced populations (p-value = 0.83, averaging respectively 1.08 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> and 1.11 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> substitutions). By contrast, nonsynonymous changes were ten-fold less frequent than synonymous changes in the native populations (p-value &amp;lt; 0.001, averaging 1.74 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22125<\/jats:sup> and 1.3 \u00d7 10<jats:sup>\u22124<\/jats:sup> substitutions, respectively). Patterns of sequence variation in the introduced range were largely congruent across the three insect orders which suggests that they are produced by general processes. This study explores the molecular evolution of introduced species, a fundamental aspect to improve understanding of their biology and manage their impact on ecosystems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389\/fevo.2023.1218690","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,7]],"date-time":"2023-07-07T14:05:49Z","timestamp":1688738749000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3389\/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Molecular evolution in introduced insect species\u2014a mitochondrial perspective","prefix":"10.3389","volume":"11","author":[{"given":"Jacopo","family":"D\u2019Ercole","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Roger","family":"Vila","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Leonardo","family":"Dapporto","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mikko","family":"Pentinsaari","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gerard","family":"Talavera","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vlad","family":"Dinc\u0103","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Paul D.
