Despite their significant role as vectors, the distribution of <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> species in non\u2010farmland habitats remains largely unknown. We conducted a study to assess the species community composition, abundance, and host feeding patterns of <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> biting midges in urban ecosystems in northern Spain. Light\u2010baited suction traps were operated biweekly for 6\u2009months across six urban landscapes (three cemeteries and three green areas). In total, 181 <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> specimens of 18 species were morphologically identified, with the <jats:italic>Obsoletus<\/jats:italic> complex being predominant (43.% of the total catches), followed by <jats:italic>Culicoides kibunensis<\/jats:italic> (21.5%). <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> midges peaked in early June in green areas and in May in cemeteries. Host feeding patterns revealed avian preferences (mainly <jats:italic>Turdus<\/jats:italic> spp.) in four <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> species. Despite the low overall number of specimens collected, a high diversity of biting midge species was recorded. These findings offer critical insights into <jats:italic>Culicoides<\/jats:italic> ecology and their interactions with hosts in urban settings, which are vital for disease surveillance and management
