Urban parks provide refuges for ecologically-important biodiversity, such as insect pollinators. While residents may be unlikely to notice small insects, butterflies are more likely to be noticed and to provide positive human-\u201cnature\u201d interactions. Engaging residents and city planners in promoting habitat for butterflies is valid conservation practice and has well-understood educational and well-being benefits. Surveying and monitoring is an essential activity to corroborate, improve and communicate the outcomes of conservation practices amongst city governments, scientists and other stakeholders. Here we present the data from a survey of butterflies in urban parks in the megacity of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region as part of the \"Urban biodiversity and human well-being in East-Southeast Asia's megacities\" project organised by the \"Urban Butterflies in Asia Research Network\".<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We recorded 51 species of butterflies from ten urban parks in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. This was more than double the 25 species reported in Bangkok's City Biodiversity Index application. However, this was lower than that recorded in other megacities in Southeast Asia, such as Kuala Lumpur at 60 species. Most of the butterflies recorded were common and widespread species. DNA barcodes are provided for most of the butterflies sampled.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3897\/bdj.8.e56317","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]],"date-time":"2020-10-12T14:00:37Z","timestamp":1602511237000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Butterflies in urban parks in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand","prefix":"10.3897","volume":"8","author":[{"given":"Narong","family":"Jaturas","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kong-Wah","family":"Sing","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3583-3550","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"John-James","family":"Wilson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hui","family":"Dong","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"2258","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"56317_B5918745","author":"Ek-Amnuay","year":"2012","journal-title":"Butterflies of Thailand"},{"key":"56317_B5928805","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/cobi.12840"},{"key":"56317_B5918844","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/20964129.2018.1511225"},{"key":"56317_B5924637","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1186\/s40555-014-0090-7"},{"key":"56317_B5924606","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/ens.12146"},{"key":"56317_B5924615","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3956\/2018-94.4.195"},{"key":"56317_B5918688","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11252-016-0579-4"},{"key":"56317_B5918771","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1471-8286.2007.01678.x"},{"key":"56317_B5918780","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0066213"},{"key":"56317_B5918670","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1088\/1748-9326\/10\/3\/034002"},{"key":"56317_B5918715","article-title":"City Biodiversity Index (or Singapore Index)","author":"Diversity"},{"key":"56317_B5916036","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1139\/gen-2015-0192"},{"key":"56317_B5916027","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11252-016-0542-4"},{"issue":"11","key":"56317_B5916080","first-page":"997","article-title":"Butterfly diversity in Asia's megacities","volume":"60","author":"Sing","year":"2017","journal-title":"Genome"},{"key":"56317_B5916067","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-019-43997-8"},{"key":"56317_B5918853","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1002\/fee.1225"},{"key":"56317_B5918697","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/194008291500800112"},{"key":"56317_B5918706","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.ecolind.2019.05.051"},{"key":"56317_B5918640","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0079969"},{"key":"56317_B5918658","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3897\/BDJ.3.e7159"},{"key":"56317_B5918762","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/b978-0-12-809633-8.20468-8"},{"key":"56317_B5918632","article-title":"Urban butterflies in Asia research network","author":"Wilson"},{"key":"56317_B5918753","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/978-1-61779-591-6_3"}],"container-title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/56317\/download\/pdf\/","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/56317\/download\/xml\/","content-type":"application\/xml","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article_preview.php?id=56317&skip_redirect=1","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]],"date-time":"2020-10-12T14:00:46Z","timestamp":1602511246000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/56317\/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]},"references-count":23,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/bdj.8.e56317","relation":{},"ISSN":["1314-2828","1314-2836"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"BDJ","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,12]]}}
