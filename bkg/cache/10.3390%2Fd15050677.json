This species is known only in its sporophyte (Conchocelis) stage, being possibly asexual and lacking the charismatic and \u201ccollectable\u201d gametophyte stage. Consequently, little is known of its range and distribution. Taxon-targeted metabarcoding was explored as a pathway to gain insights into the vertical (intertidal versus subtidal) and biogeographical distribution of this species, as well as to assess host diversity. We also wanted to ascertain if other species occur in only the Conchocelis stage in the Canadian flora. Primers targeting a short (521 bp) region of the plastid rbcL gene in the Bangiales were used to screen DNA from 285 coralline crusts collected throughout Canada and adjacent waters. In addition to confirming the presence of P. corallicola in the Bay of Fundy, this species was recovered from coralline crusts along the coast of Nova Scotia (n = 1) and in the low Arctic (Labrador; n = 2), greatly extending its range and suggesting it is a cold-water taxon. We have confirmed its presence in both the low intertidal and subtidal (to 10 m), and its occurrence in three different coralline species, suggesting that it lacks host specificity. In total, nine genetic groups of Bangiales were uncovered in our survey, six matching entries currently in GenBank and three apparently novel genetic groups\u2014two from the northeast Pacific and one from the low Arctic. Notable host and ecological patterns are discussed. This method, when further developed, will facilitate the study of Conchocelis stages in nature, which will greatly enhance ecological knowledge of bangialean species.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/d15050677","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,18]],"date-time":"2023-05-18T11:35:50Z","timestamp":1684409750000},"page":"677","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":"Metabarcoding Extends the Distribution of Porphyra corallicola (Bangiales) into the Arctic While Revealing Novel Species and Patterns for Conchocelis Stages in the Canadian Flora","prefix":"10.3390","volume":"15","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4813-6831","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gary W.","family":"Saunders","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biology, Centre for Environmental & Molecular Algal Research, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada"}]},{"given":"Cody M.","family":"Brooks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biology, Centre for Environmental & Molecular Algal Research, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, NB E3B 5A3, Canada"},{"name":"Bedford Institute of Oceanography, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Dartmouth, NS B2Y 4A2, Canada"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,18]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1131","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1529-8817.2011.01052.x","article-title":"A new look at an ancient order: Generic revision of the Bangiales (Rhodophyta)","volume":"47","author":"Sutherland","year":"2011","journal-title":"J.
