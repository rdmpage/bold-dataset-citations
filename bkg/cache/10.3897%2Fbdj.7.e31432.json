Our data release provides the first large-scale diversity assessment of Indonesian coleoptera obtained by canopy fogging. The project combined extensive fieldwork with databasing, DNA barcode based species delineation and the release of results in collaboration with Indonesian counterparts, aimed at supporting further analyses of the data. Canopy fogging on 28 trees was undertaken at two different sites, Cikaniki and Gunung Botol, in the south-eastern area of the Gunung Halimun-Salak National Park in West Java, Indonesia. In total, 7,447 specimens of Coleoptera were processed, of which 3,836 specimens produced DNA barcode sequences that were longer than 300 bp. A total of 3,750 specimens were assigned a Barcode Index Number (BIN), including 2,013 specimens from Cikaniki and 1,737 specimens from Gunung Botol. The 747 BINs, that were obtained, represented 39 families of Coleoptera. The distribution of specimens with BINs per tree was quite heterogeneous in both sites even in terms of the abundance of specimens or diversity of BINs. The specimen distribution per taxon was heterogeneous as well. Some 416 specimens could not be identified to family level, corresponding to 72 BINs that lack a family level identification. The data have shown a large heterogeneity in terms of abundance and distribution of BINs between sites, trees and families of Coleoptera. From the total of 747 BINs that were recovered, 421 (56%) are exclusive from a single tree. Although the two study sites were in close proximity and separated by a distance of only about five kilometres, the number of shared BINs between sites is low, with 81 of the 747 BINs. With this data release, we expect to shed some light on the largely hidden diversity in the canopy of tropical forests in Indonesia and elsewhere.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3897\/bdj.7.e31432","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,15]],"date-time":"2019-01-15T03:00:27Z","timestamp":1547521227000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":"DNA barcoding data release for Coleoptera from the Gunung Halimun canopy fogging workpackage of the Indonesian Biodiversity Information System (IndoBioSys) project","prefix":"10.3897","volume":"7","author":[{"given":"Bruno","family":"Cancian de Araujo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-5751-8706","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Stefan","family":"Schmidt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Olga","family":"Schmidt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Thomas","family":"von Rintelen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4167-3570","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Kristina","family":"von Rintelen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Andreas","family":"Floren","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rosichon","family":"Ubaidillah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Djunijanti","family":"Peggie","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Balke","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"2258","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,15]]},"reference":[{"key":"31432_B4734358","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/sysbio\/syu047"},{"key":"31432_B4717544","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.14203\/treubia.v44i0.3381"},{"key":"31432_B4688743","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3897\/bdj.6.e25237"},{"key":"31432_B4735723","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1126\/sciadv.1400253"},{"key":"31432_B4716607","volume":"8","author":"Floren","year":"2010","journal-title":"Manual on Field Recording Techniques and Protocols for All Taxa Biodiversity Inventories"},{"key":"31432_B4733809","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/978-94-011-2282-5"},{"key":"31432_B4734582","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1098\/rspb.2002.2218"},{"key":"31432_B4733897","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1755-0998.2009.02628.x"},{"key":"31432_B4736352","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1146\/annurev-ecolsys-102710-145001"},{"key":"31432_B4734377","author":"Mittermeier","year":"1997","journal-title":"Megadiversity: earth\u2019s biologically wealthiest nations"},{"key":"31432_B4734347","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/35002501"},{"key":"31432_B4735806","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1046\/j.1523-1739.2003.03158.x"},{"key":"31432_B4719716","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3897\/rio.3.e20860"},{"key":"31432_B4727755","article-title":"A fast track to biodiversity in the 21st century - the Indobiosys project","author":"Rintelen"},{"key":"31432_B4717532","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3897\/bdj.5.e20006"},{"key":"31432_B4736341","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-017-09084-6"},{"key":"31432_B4735831","author":"Wheeler","year":"1996","journal-title":"Biodiversity II: understanding and protecting our biological resource"},{"key":"31432_B4735816","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1098\/rstb.2003.1452"}],"container-title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/31432\/download\/pdf\/","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/31432\/download\/xml\/","content-type":"application\/xml","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article_preview.php?id=31432&skip_redirect=1","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,15]],"date-time":"2019-01-15T03:00:30Z","timestamp":1547521230000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/31432\/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,15]]},"references-count":18,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/bdj.7.e31432","relation":{},"ISSN":["1314-2828","1314-2836"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"BDJ","published":{"date-parts":[[2019,1,15]]}}
