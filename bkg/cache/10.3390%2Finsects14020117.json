This invasive pest was confirmed in 24 out of 58 administrative regions of Russia, which it has occupied for approximately 16 years. Analysis of the COI mtDNA gene sequenced in 201 specimens collected in 21 regions of the European part of Russia indicates the occurrence of two haplotypes (A and B), which are also present in the secondary range of C.\u00a0ohridella in Eastern and Western Europe. The haplotype A dominated and was present in 87.5% of specimens from European Russia. In 2021, C. ohridella produced spectacular outbreaks in Aesculus hippocastanum in southern Russia, where it damaged more than 50% of the leaves in trees in 24 out of 30 distant localities. In the south of the country, the pest infested Acer pseudoplatanus, whereas other species of Acer of European, East Asian, and North American origin showed no signs of attacks. Taking into account that Ae. hippocastanum is present in most regions of European Russia, we expect a further range expansion of C. ohridella up to the Ural Mountains.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/insects14020117","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,25]],"date-time":"2023-01-25T08:23:49Z","timestamp":1674635029000},"page":"117","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":"Invasion Genetics of the Horse-Chestnut Leaf Miner, Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), in European Russia: A Case of Successful Involvement of Citizen Science in Studying an Alien Insect Pest","prefix":"10.3390","volume":"14","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7362-6464","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Natalia I.","family":"Kirichenko","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Federal Research Center \u2018Krasnoyarsk Science Center SB RAS\u2019, Akademgorodok 50\/28, 660036 Krasnoyarsk, Russia"},{"name":"Institute of Ecology and Geography, Siberian Federal University, Svobodny pr. 79, 660041 Krasnoyarsk, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7696-3618","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Natalia N.","family":"Karpun","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Federal Research Centre the Subtropical Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yana Fabritsiusa Street 2\/28, 354002 Sochi, Russia"},{"name":"Department of Forest Protection, Wood Science and Game Management, Saint Petersburg State Forest Technical University, Institutskiy per. 5, 194021 Saint Petersburg, Russia"}]},{"given":"Elena N.","family":"Zhuravleva","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Federal Research Centre the Subtropical Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yana Fabritsiusa Street 2\/28, 354002 Sochi, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4942-1546","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Elena I.","family":"Shoshina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Federal Research Centre the Subtropical Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Yana Fabritsiusa Street 2\/28, 354002 Sochi, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8575-5418","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Vasily V.","family":"Anikin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Animal Morphology and Ecology, Chernyshevsky Saratov State University, Astrakhanskaya Street 83, 410012 Saratov, Russia"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3913-3674","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Dmitrii L.","family":"Musolin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO\/OEPP), 21 boulevard Richard Lenoir, 75011 Paris, France"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,24]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"182","DOI":"10.1002\/ece3.431","article-title":"Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature","volume":"3","author":"Lowry","year":"2012","journal-title":"Ecol.
