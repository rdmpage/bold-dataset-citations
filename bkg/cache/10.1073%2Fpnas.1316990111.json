To reconstruct interactions in the High Arctic, we draw on three sources of information: two based on DNA sequence data and one on the rearing of parasitoids from their hosts. Overall, we show that a combination of all three techniques will not only provide high resolution for describing feeding associations among individual species, but also revamp our view of the overall structure of the target network. Thus, our findings suggest that combining several types of information will fundamentally change our impression of both how local interaction webs are structured, and how biotic interactions are patterned across the globe.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1073\/pnas.1316990111","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,22]],"date-time":"2014-01-22T04:02:30Z","timestamp":1390363350000},"page":"1885-1890","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1073\/pnas.cm10313","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":143,"title":"Complementary molecular information changes our perception of food web structure","prefix":"10.1073","volume":"111","author":[{"given":"Helena K.","family":"Wirta","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Spatial Foodweb Ecology Group, Department of Agricultural Sciences, University of Helsinki, FI-00014, Helsinki, Finland;"}]},{"given":"Paul D.
