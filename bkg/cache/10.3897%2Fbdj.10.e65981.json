Colombia has 1,610 freshwater fish species and comprises the second largest diversity of this group in the world. As genetic information continues to be limited, we constructed a reference collection of DNA sequences of Colombian freshwater fishes deposited in the Ichthyology Collection of the University of Antioquia (CIUA), thus joining the multiple efforts that have been made in the country to contribute to the knowledge of genetic diversity in order to strengthen the inventories of biological collections and facilitate the solution of taxonomic issues in the future.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This study contributes to the knowledge on the DNA barcodes and occurrence records of 96 species of Colombian freshwater fishes. Fifty-seven of the species represented in this dataset were already available in the Barcode Of Life Data System (BOLD System), while 39 correspond to new species to the BOLD System. Forty-nine specimens were collected in the Atrato River Basin and 708 in the Magdalena-Cauca asin during the period 2010-2020. Two species (<jats:italic>Loricariichthys brunneus<\/jats:italic> (Hancock, 1828) and <jats:italic>Poecilia sphenops<\/jats:italic> Valenciennes, 1846) are considered exotic to the Atrato, Cauca and Magdalena Basins and four species (<jats:italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss<\/jats:italic> (Walbaum, 1792), <jats:italic>Oreochromis niloticus<\/jats:italic> (Linnaeus, 1758), <jats:italic>Parachromis friedrichsthalii<\/jats:italic> (Heckel, 1840) and <jats:italic>Xiphophorus helleri<\/jats:italic> Heckel, 1848) are exotic to the Colombian hydrogeographic regions. All specimens are deposited in CIUA and have their DNA barcodes made publicly available in the BOLD online database. The geographical distribution dataset can be freely accessed through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3897\/bdj.10.e65981","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]],"date-time":"2022-01-06T03:00:13Z","timestamp":1641438013000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Contribution to a reference library of DNA barcodes of Colombian freshwater fishes","prefix":"10.3897","volume":"10","author":[{"given":"Manuela","family":"Mej\u00eda-Estrada","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0784-0355","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Luz Fernanda","family":"Jim\u00e9nez-Segura","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marcela","family":"Hern\u00e1ndez-Zapata","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6311-8378","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Iv\u00e1n","family":"Soto Calder\u00f3n","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"2258","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"reference":[{"key":"65981_B6641183","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1146\/annurev-ecolsys-011620-031032"},{"key":"65981_B7476524","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/jfb.14098"},{"key":"65981_B6641283","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3897\/zookeys.708.13897"},{"key":"65981_B6641243","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.15472\/numrso"},{"key":"65981_B7476515","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/1755-0998.12385"},{"key":"65981_B6641261","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1098\/rspb.2002.2218"},{"key":"65981_B6641252","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/978-1-61779-591-6_1"},{"key":"65981_B7412594","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1471-8286.2006.01678.x"},{"key":"65981_B6641232","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/jfb.13016"},{"key":"65981_B6641295","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1098\/rstb.2005.1716"},{"key":"65981_B6641334","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1095-8649.2008.02080.x"}],"container-title":"Biodiversity Data Journal","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/65981\/download\/pdf\/","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/65981\/download\/xml\/","content-type":"application\/xml","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article_preview.php?id=65981&skip_redirect=1","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]],"date-time":"2022-01-06T03:00:17Z","timestamp":1641438017000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/bdj.pensoft.net\/article\/65981\/"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"references-count":11,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3897\/bdj.10.e65981","relation":{"has-preprint":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.3897\/arphapreprints.e68554","asserted-by":"subject"},{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.3897\/arphapreprints.e68554","asserted-by":"object"}]},"ISSN":["1314-2828","1314-2836"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"BDJ","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]}}
