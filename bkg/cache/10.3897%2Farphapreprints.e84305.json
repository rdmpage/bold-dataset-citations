For many poorly known taxa, such reference sequences are missing even at higher-level taxonomic scales.\u00a0We harvested the collections of the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History (USNM) to generate DNA barcoding sequences for genera of terrestrial arthropods previously not recorded in one or more major public sequence databases. Our workflow used a mix of Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches to maximize sequence recovery while ensuring affordable cost. In total, COI sequences were obtained for 5,686 specimens belonging to 3,888 genera and 202 families. Success rates varied widely according to collection data and focal taxon. NGS helped recover sequences of specimens that failed a previous run of Sanger sequencing. Success rates and the optimal balance between Sanger and NGS are the most important drivers to maximize output and minimize cost in future projects. The corresponding sequence and taxonomic data can be accessed through the Barcode of Life Data System, GenBank, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Global Genome Biodiversity Network Data Portal and the NMNH data portal.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3897\/arphapreprints.e84305","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,28]],"date-time":"2022-03-28T06:15:08Z","timestamp":1648448108000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Enhancing DNA barcode reference libraries by harvesting terrestrial arthropods at the National Museum of Natural History","prefix":"10.3897","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2634-3066","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Bernardo","family":"Santos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Meredith","family":"Miller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Margarita","family":"Miklasevskaja","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0005-7193-2643","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jaclyn","family":"McKeown","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Niamh","family":"Redmond","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6004-7730","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jonathan","family":"Coddington","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jessica","family":"Bird","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4138-1378","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Scott","family":"Miller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ashton","family":"Smith","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0468-940X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Se\u00e1n","family":"Brady","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1900-3861","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Matthew","family":"Buffington","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3536-9372","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"M.
