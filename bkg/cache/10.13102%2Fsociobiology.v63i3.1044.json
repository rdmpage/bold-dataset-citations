Eleven species are shared between the sites whilst four are exclusive to one site and 13 to other. Differences in humidity, rainfall seasonality, and disturbance regimes may account for at least part of the differences observed between the ant communities of the two sites. Dorymyrmex pyramicus peruvianum Wheeler, 1919 andPseudomyrmex kuenckeli (Emery, 1890) are reported from Ecuador for the first time. Cardiocondyla emeryi Forel, 1881 and Camponotus conspicuus zonatus Emery, 1894are reported from mainland Ecuador for the first time. The genus Dorymyrmex Mayr, 1866 is recorded from Ecuador for the first time.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.13102\/sociobiology.v63i3.1044","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,27]],"date-time":"2016-10-27T18:07:37Z","timestamp":1477591657000},"page":"909","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Survey of Ants in Dry Forests of Southwestern Ecuador (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)","prefix":"10.13102","volume":"63","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6793-3003","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"John E.","family":"Lattke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Manuel","family":"V\u00e9lez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Nikolay","family":"Aguirre","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5255","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,25]]},"container-title":"Sociobiology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/index.php\/sociobiology\/article\/viewFile\/1044\/867","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/index.php\/sociobiology\/article\/viewFile\/1044\/867","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,27]],"date-time":"2016-10-27T18:07:41Z","timestamp":1477591661000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/index.php\/sociobiology\/article\/view\/1044"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,25]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,25]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.13102\/sociobiology.v63i3.1044","relation":{},"ISSN":["2447-8067","0361-6525"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"Sociobiology","published":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,25]]}}
