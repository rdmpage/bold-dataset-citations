A total of nine syrphid species were recorded from the five archipelagos of French Polynesia. Among them are two species new to science, Allograpta jacqi Mengual &amp; Ramage sp. nov. and Melanostoma polynesiotes Mengual &amp; Ramage sp. nov., and a new record for this country, Syritta aenigmatopatria Hardy, 1964. We provide DNA barcodes for all flower fly species of French Polynesia, making the syrphid fauna of this country the first one in the world to be entirely barcoded. New data on biology, flowers visited and some taxonomic notes are provided. An identification key for the species of Syrphidae in French Polynesia is given, as well as an identification key for the species of Melanostoma Schiner, 1860 in the Australasian and Oceanian Regions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5852\/ejt.2018.448","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]],"date-time":"2018-07-04T09:38:35Z","timestamp":1530697115000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":"Flower flies (Diptera, Syrphidae) of French Polynesia, with the description of two new species","prefix":"10.5852","author":[{"given":"Thibault","family":"Ramage","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Charlat","family":"Sylvain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ximo","family":"Mengual","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3904","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]},"container-title":"European Journal of Taxonomy","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/www.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu\/index.php\/ejt\/article\/viewFile\/579\/1316","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/www.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu\/index.php\/ejt\/article\/viewFile\/579\/1317","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/www.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu\/index.php\/ejt\/article\/viewFile\/579\/1317","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]],"date-time":"2018-07-04T09:38:42Z","timestamp":1530697122000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/www.europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu\/index.php\/ejt\/article\/view\/579"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"448","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.5852\/ejt.2018.448","relation":{},"ISSN":["2118-9773"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"EJT","published":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,4]]}}
