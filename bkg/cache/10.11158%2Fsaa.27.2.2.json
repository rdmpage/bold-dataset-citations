Rueda-Ram\u00edrez &amp; Santos is described based on specimens collected at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) (Maryland, USA). Twenty-one specimens were used for the description, of which five were subjected to low temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM), followed by DNA extraction for genetic analysis and subsequent slide mounting. The remaining 16 specimens were subjected to only DNA extraction for genetic analysis and subsequent slide mounting. Morphological characters of the new species observed both in the images obtained in LTSEM and in the observation of the mounted specimens are detailed. Molecular information available on the Barcode of Life Datasysetm (BOLD) is presented. An update to the recent key to the Gamasellodes species is provided.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.11158\/saa.27.2.2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]],"date-time":"2022-01-20T13:46:13Z","timestamp":1642686373000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"In memory of Gary Bauchan: Utilizing an integrated taxonomy approach for the description of a new species of Gamasellodes (Mesostigmata: Ascidae)","prefix":"10.11158","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7642-2256","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Diana","family":"Rueda-ram\u00edrez","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jandir C.","family":"Santos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7388-8202","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Monica R.","family":"Young","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7128-1397","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Joseph","family":"Mowery","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3060-7666","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gary","family":"Bauchan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1680-3601","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ronald","family":"Ochoa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4958-8920","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eric","family":"Palevsky","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"4844","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]},"container-title":"Systematic and Applied Acarology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/download\/71752\/70053","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/download\/71752\/70054","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/download\/71752\/70053","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]],"date-time":"2022-01-20T13:46:13Z","timestamp":1642686373000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/view\/71752"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.11158\/saa.27.2.2","relation":{},"ISSN":["2056-6069","1362-1971"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"saa","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]}}
