As such, investigating the diet, prey selection and prey availability of aerial insectivores can be challenging. In this study, we used an integrated DNA barcoding method to investigate the diet and food supply of Barn Swallows, an aerial insectivore whose North American population has declined over the past 40 yr. We tested the hypotheses that Barn Swallows are generalist insectivores when provisioning their young and select prey based on size. We predicted that the diets of nestlings would contain a range of insect taxa but would be biased towards large prey items and that the diet of nestlings would change as prey availability changed. We collected insects using Malaise traps at 10 breeding sites and identified specimens using standard DNA barcoding. The sequences from these insect specimens were used to create a custom reference database of prey species and their relative sizes for our study area. We identified insect prey items from nestling fecal samples by using high-throughput DNA sequencing and comparing the sequences to our custom reference database. Barn Swallows fed nestlings prey items from 130 families representing 13 orders but showed selection for larger prey items that were predominantly from 7 dipteran families. Nestling diet varied both within and between breeding seasons as well as between breeding sites. This dietary flexibility suggests that Barn Swallows are able to adjust their provisioning to changing prey availability on the breeding grounds when feeding their nestlings. Our study demonstrates the utility of custom reference databases for linking the abundance and size of insect prey in the habitat with prey consumed when employing molecular methods for dietary analysis.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/auk\/uky003","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,11]],"date-time":"2019-06-11T04:41:07Z","timestamp":1560228067000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":50,"title":"DNA metabarcoding reveals the broad and flexible diet of a declining aerial insectivore","prefix":"10.1093","volume":"136","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2804-7906","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Beverly","family":"McClenaghan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Environmental and Life Sciences Graduate Program, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada"}]},{"given":"Erica","family":"Nol","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Biology, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada"}]},{"given":"Kevin C R","family":"Kerr","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Environmental and Life Sciences Graduate Program, Trent University, Peterborough, Ontario, Canada"},{"name":"Toronto Zoo, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"}]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,2,5]]},"reference":[{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0001","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"169","DOI":"10.1017\/S0952836903003601","article-title":"Feeding ecology of the bat Eptesicus fuscus: \u201cPreferred\u201d prey abundance as one factor influencing prey selection and diet breadth","volume":"260","author":"Agosta","year":"2003","journal-title":"Journal of Zoology"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0002","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"134","DOI":"10.1111\/2041-210X.12849","article-title":"Scrutinizing key steps for reliable metabarcoding of environmental samples","volume":"9","author":"Alberdi","year":"2017","journal-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0003","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"411","DOI":"10.1017\/S0959270912000056","article-title":"Maintenance of livestock farming may buffer population decline of the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica","volume":"22","author":"Ambrosini","year":"2012","journal-title":"Bird Conservation International"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0004","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","DOI":"10.5962\/bhl.title.108596","volume-title":"Food habits of the swallows: A family of valuable native birds","author":"Beal","year":"1918"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0005","first-page":"416","article-title":"Birds and mammals on an insect diet: A primer on diet composition analysis in relation to ecological energetics","volume-title":"Avian Foraging: Theory, Methodology, and Applications","author":"Bell","year":"1990"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0006","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"81","DOI":"10.1038\/nature04539","article-title":"Climate change and population declines in a long-distance migratory bird","volume":"444","author":"Both","year":"2006","journal-title":"Nature"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0007","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0083152","article-title":"From puffins to plankton: A DNA-based analysis of a seabird food chain in the Northern Gulf of Maine","volume":"8","author":"Bowser","year":"2013","journal-title":"PLoS ONE"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0008","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"73","DOI":"10.2307\/2426080","article-title":"Prey selection by big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and Common Nighthawks (Chordeiles minor)","volume":"124","author":"Brigham","year":"1990","journal-title":"American Midland Naturalist"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0009","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","DOI":"10.2173\/bna.452","article-title":"Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica)","volume-title":"The Birds of North America","author":"Brown","year":"1999"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0010","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"381","DOI":"10.1590\/S0301-80592000000300001","article-title":"Comparison of the efficiency of flight-interception trap models for sampling Hymenoptera and other insects","volume":"29","author":"Campos","year":"2000","journal-title":"Anais de Sociedade Entomologica do Brasil"},{"key":"2019072309400007100_CIT0011","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"3633","DOI":"10.1111\/mec.12519","article-title":"An inordinate fondness for beetles?
