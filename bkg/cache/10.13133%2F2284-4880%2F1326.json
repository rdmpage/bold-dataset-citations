  "abstract": "Adelidae fauna of South Italy is poorly known. For example, the knowledge concerning this family in the Calabria region is very poor being the most recent record 107 years old. In this paper we reported original faunistic data for the Calabria region concerning eight species most of which new for the regional fauna and Nematopogon robertella (Clerck, 1759) new for the fauna of peninsular Italy. To the light of faunistic and taxonomic advances of recent years, the Italian checklist of this family was updated because of the discovery of taxa new to the science and new records that significantly modified the Italian range of some species. According to these recent additions, the Italian fauna of Adelidae is now composed by 34 species, but we found that some populations of South Italy deserve deep studies to ascertain their taxonomic status.",
