One species occurs from Central Europe into Transcaucasia and agrees with the taxon O. brevicornis of Loew (1843). The second species, O. atlantica \u017b\u00f3ralski &amp; Van de Meutter sp. nov., has its main distribution range in the Atlantic parts of Europe and is described here. We provide a redescription of O. brevicornis and designate a neotype from the type locality (Poland, Posen [= Pozna\u0144] vicinity). The most important characters for distinguishing males of these two closely related species are in the structures of the terminalia. A diagnosis and identification key to European black-legged Orthonevra species is given as well as new sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), also known as DNA barcodes, for most of the species of this group. Some new information and changes to the known ranges of Orthonevra species are provided as a result of this revisionary work: O. frontalis (Loew, 1843) is removed from the list of species occurring in Poland; O. gemmula Violovitsh, 1979 is confirmed from Hungary; O. incisa (Loew, 1843) is confirmed from its locus typicus (Poland, Posen vicinity); and O. montana Vuji\u0107, 1999 is reported from Poland and Austria for the first time and confirmed for Germany. An explanation for some previous records published as O. plumbago (Loew, 1840) is also given.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.37520\/aemnp.2024.015","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]],"date-time":"2024-10-01T02:24:28Z","timestamp":1727749468000},"page":"223-242","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Two Palaearctic species of Orthonevra (Diptera: Syrphidae) under the name O. brevicornis","prefix":"10.37520","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6017-2144","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"\u017b\u00d3RALSKI","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Norwida 9, 84-240 Reda, Poland"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9850-1860","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Frank","family":"VAN DE MEUTTER","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Research Institute for Nature and Forests (INBO), Achterheide 16, 3980 Tessenderlo, Belgium"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6185-9404","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ximo","family":"Mengual","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Museum Koenig Bonn, Leibniz-Institut zur Analyse des Biodiversit\u00e4tswandels, Adenauerallee 127, 53113 Bonn, Germany"}]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9334-1960","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Piotr","family":"GADAWSKI","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Lodz, Department of Invertebrate Zoology and Hydrobiology, Banacha 12\/16, 90-237 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland"}]}],"member":"23785","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"container-title":"Acta Entomologica Musei Nationalis Pragae","original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]],"date-time":"2024-10-01T02:24:29Z","timestamp":1727749469000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.aemnp.eu\/acta-entomologica\/volume-64-1\/64_1_223.html"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.37520\/aemnp.2024.015","relation":{},"ISSN":["1804-6487","0374-1036"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"aemnp","published":{"date-parts":[[2024,10,1]]}}
