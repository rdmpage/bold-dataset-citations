Illustrations and identification keys are provided for these new species, and in order to facilitate further research of Ciidae we present an open-access DNA barcode library (dx.doi.org\/10.5883\/DS-SYNCOSM) containing 114 records (of 44 species in 14 genera), 15 of which belong to the newly described species. A phylogenetic analysis based on the barcode fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I gene did not recover much tree structure within Ciidae, however both Xylographus Melli\u00e9 and Syncosmetus Sharp were recovered as clades, with a single Scolytocis Blair being the sister to the latter.\u00a0<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.11646\/zootaxa.4006.3.3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,25]],"date-time":"2015-08-25T01:09:10Z","timestamp":1440464950000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":16,"title":"First record and five new species of Xylographellini (Coleoptera: Ciidae)\u00a0from China, with online DNA barcode library of the family","prefix":"10.11646","volume":"4006","author":[{"given":"CRISTIANO","family":"LOPES-ANDRADE","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"VASILY V.","family":"GREBENNIKOV","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"4913","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,25]]},"container-title":"Zootaxa","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/mapress.com\/zt\/article\/download\/zootaxa.4006.3.3\/35945","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/mapress.com\/zt\/article\/download\/zootaxa.4006.3.3\/35945","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,3,18]],"date-time":"2024-03-18T00:54:13Z","timestamp":1710723253000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/mapress.com\/zt\/article\/view\/zootaxa.4006.3.3"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,25]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,25]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.11646\/zootaxa.4006.3.3","relation":{},"ISSN":["1175-5334","1175-5326"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"Zootaxa","published":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,25]]}}
