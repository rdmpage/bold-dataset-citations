However, the key personnel for performing such studies are expert taxonomists, who are already spread very thin. To meet this demand, we propose an integrative approach where scientists (without expertise in taxonomy) play a significant role in supporting expert taxonomists. Soil samples were collected at the USDA ARS Farming Systems Project (FSP) at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, either incubated or not, followed by extraction of mites and nematodes. Improved modified Berlese funnels and an extraction protocol were utilized to improve sequencing success. Incubation dramatically enhanced the number of extracted individuals per sample whilst the daily freezing of extracted mites substantially improved the sequencing success rate compared to previous studies. Taken together, this led to the addition of records for eight Mesostigmata and ten Oribatida BINs to BOLD (Barcode of Life Datasystem). Fifteen species of Mesostigmata species were found, with three dominant species, Cycetogamasus diviortus (Athias-Henriot, 1967) (Parasitidae), Lasioseius youcefi Athias-Henriot 1959 (Blattisociidae) and a new species of Gamasellodes (Ascidae). LTSEM imaging followed by molecular identification contributed further details to the published descriptions of C. diviortus and L. youcefi. In line with our general aim, collecting, extracting, identification to morpho-species, sample preparation for DNA barcoding and uploading relevant information to BOLD was performed by trained personnel, but without taxonomic expertise. Whereas our skilled taxonomists focused on the morphological identifications using light microscopy, expanding on existing descriptions using LTSEM images and in a subsequent manuscript the description of a new species. We believe this division of tasks and labor will set the stage for further collaborative integrated studies between ecologists, biocontrol specialists and expert taxonomists for the identification, evaluation, and description of known and novel soil acarine biological control agents (BCAs).\n\u00a0<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.11158\/saa.27.2.3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]],"date-time":"2022-01-20T13:46:18Z","timestamp":1642686378000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"In memory of Gary Bauchan: Integrated taxonomy of soil mites in farming systems","prefix":"10.11158","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7642-2256","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Diana","family":"Rueda-Ram\u00edrez","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lynn","family":"Carta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Joseph","family":"Mowery","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gary","family":"Bauchan","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ronald","family":"Ochoa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7388-8202","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Monica","family":"Young","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jandir Cruz","family":"Santos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4958-8920","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eric","family":"Palevsky","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"4844","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]},"container-title":"Systematic and Applied Acarology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/download\/71119\/70055","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/download\/71119\/70056","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/download\/71119\/70055","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,20]],"date-time":"2022-01-20T13:46:19Z","timestamp":1642686379000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/saa\/article\/view\/71119"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.11158\/saa.27.2.3","relation":{},"ISSN":["2056-6069","1362-1971"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"saa","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]}}
