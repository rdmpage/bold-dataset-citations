While the species richness of many arthropod higher taxa declines at high elevations, those species that do reside in TMCF are often highly specialised and endemic, rendering their natural history especially interesting. However, we know little about these TMCF arthropods. One genus of ants, <jats:italic>Adelomyrmex<\/jats:italic> Emery, 1897 (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), is characteristic of many TMCFs in Central America, and exemplifies this pattern. While workers of this genus are very common in leaf litter samples, winged males and winged queens have been unknown and nests have never been observed for most species. Here we report how a combination of affordable digital field microscopes and DNA barcoding has allowed nest discovery and documentation and linked male and worker <jats:italic>Adelomyrmex.<\/jats:italic> Based on this work, we have now learned that male <jats:italic>Adelomyrmex<\/jats:italic> can be quite abundant locally.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4039\/tce.2014.82","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,13]],"date-time":"2015-01-13T12:50:33Z","timestamp":1421153433000},"page":"611-616","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":"Observations of <i>Adelomyrmex<\/i> (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) reproductive biology facilitated by digital field microscopy and DNA barcoding","prefix":"10.4039","volume":"147","author":[{"given":"M.
