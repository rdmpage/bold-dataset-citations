Two candidate boundaries potentially explain faunistic diversity patterns in the regions: Lydekker\u2019s and Wallace\u2019s lines. The islands in between both \u2018lines\u2019 are jointly termed Wallacea, with Sulawesi as the largest landmass. We surveyed Dacini fruit flies (Tephritidae: Dacinae) in Sulawesi between 2016 and 2019 using traps baited with male lures, resulting in 4,517 collected flies. We identified all specimens to species level, which adds 15 new species records to the island, bringing the total number of Dacini species in Sulawesi to 83. The biogeographic affinity of species in the updated checklist reveals a strong connection with former \u2018Sunda\u2019 (41% of species); validating Lydekker\u2019s line, but also a high level of endemism (47% of species), confirming the uniqueness of Wallacea as a biogeographic region. We further describe a new species, Bactrocera (Bactrocera) niogreta Doorenweerd, <jats:bold>sp. nov.<\/jats:bold> and discuss the taxonomy of several interesting species.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3897\/zookeys.973.55327","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]],"date-time":"2020-10-05T14:36:56Z","timestamp":1601908616000},"page":"103-122","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"The Dacini fruit fly fauna of Sulawesi fits Lydekker\u2019s line but also supports Wallacea as a biogeographic region (Diptera, Tephritidae)","prefix":"10.3897","volume":"973","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0418-4439","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Camiel","family":"Doorenweerd","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Arni","family":"Ekayanti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Daniel","family":"Rubinoff","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"2258","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,5]]},"reference":[{"key":"55327_B1","first-page":"1","article-title":"Host plant records for fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae).","volume":"7","author":"Allwood","year":"1999","journal-title":"The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology Supplement"},{"key":"55327_B2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3897\/zookeys.730.21786"},{"key":"55327_B3","first-page":"1","article-title":"The tropical fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae: Dacinae) of the Australasian and Oceanian regions.","volume":"1","author":"Drew","year":"1989","journal-title":"Memoirs of the Queensland Museum"},{"key":"55327_B4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1017\/S1367426900000278"},{"key":"55327_B5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1046\/j.1440-6055.2001.00222.x"},{"journal-title":"Tropical Fruit Flies of South-East Asia.","year":"2013","author":"Drew","key":"55327_B6"},{"year":"2016","author":"Drew","key":"55327_B7"},{"key":"55327_B8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/1755-0998.12783"},{"key":"55327_B9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1146\/annurev-ento-010715-023603"},{"year":"1998","author":"Hall","key":"55327_B10"},{"key":"55327_B11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3767\/000651909X475941"},{"key":"55327_B12","first-page":"173","article-title":"The Dacini of Sulawesi (Diptera: Tephritidae).","volume":"28","author":"Hardy","year":"1982","journal-title":"Treubia"},{"key":"55327_B13","first-page":"147","article-title":"Studies in the fruit flies of the Philippine Islands, Indonesia and Malaya.
