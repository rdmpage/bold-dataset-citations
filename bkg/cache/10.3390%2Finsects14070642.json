Overall, six moths were reared from the leaf mines and identified based on adult morphology (forewing pattern and male genitalia) and three of them were DNA barcoding. Description of the leaf mines that allowed us to distinguish the damage of Ch. ostensackenella from other gracillariids associated with R. pseudoacacia is provided. The phylogeographic analysis comparing the DNA barcodes from Russia with those from other invaded countries in Europe (Italy) and East Asia (South Korea and Japan) and from the native range (North America) was performed. Intraspecific genetic diversity reached 3.29%. Altogether, 10 haplotypes were revealed among 21 studied specimens in the Holarctic. The detection of one haplotype common for Japan and the USA (North Carolina) suggests that the invasion to East Asia could have happened from the USA directly, rather than through Europe. A shared haplotype defined for Japan and the Russian Far East points at a possible moth species\u2019 spread to Primorsky Krai from earlier invaded Hokkaido. Further distribution of Ch. ostensackenella in East Asia and Europe is expected, bearing in mind the wide planting of R. pseudoacacia in these continents. Furthermore, an accidental introduction of the moth to the Southern Hemisphere, where black locust was introduced, is not ruled out.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/insects14070642","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,17]],"date-time":"2023-07-17T05:06:36Z","timestamp":1689570396000},"page":"642","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"First Discovery of the North American Leaf-Mining Moth Chrysaster ostensackenella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) in Russia: The Genetic Diversity of a Novel Pest in Invaded vs. Native Range","prefix":"10.3390","volume":"14","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7362-6464","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Natalia I.","family":"Kirichenko","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Federal Research Center \u00abKrasnoyarsk Science Center SB RAS\u00bb, Akademgorodok 50\/28, 660036 Krasnoyarsk, Russia"},{"name":"Institute of Ecology & Geography, Siberian Federal University, Svobobny pr. 79, 660041 Krasnoyarsk, Russia"}]},{"given":"Nina A.","family":"Kolyada","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Federal Scientific Center of the East Asia Terrestrial Biodiversity, Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 100-Let Vladivostoku Ave. 159, 690022 Vladivostok, Russia"}]},{"given":"Stanislav","family":"Gomboc","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Independent Researcher, Gan\u010dani 110, 9231 Beltinci, Slovenia"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,15]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","unstructured":"Maslyakov, V.Y., and Izhevskiy, S.S.
