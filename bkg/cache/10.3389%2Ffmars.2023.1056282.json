These nodules are rock formations containing valuable metals and minerals targeted for mining. They further provide diverse habitat for a range of deep-sea species. Little is known so far on the taxonomy, natural history and biogeography of these deep-sea animals which is vital for accurate assessment of the risk of species extinctions from large-scale mining. One of the most abundant megafaunal groups in the CCZ is the Ophiuroidea (brittle stars), of which <jats:italic>Ophiotholia<\/jats:italic> is one of the more abundant genera found in the area. The genus <jats:italic>Ophiotholia<\/jats:italic> has a world-wide distribution and currently holds six species.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods<\/jats:title><jats:p>Material collected from seven scientific cruises to the CCZ was examined, morphologically, together with comparative material from all the known species. The small size and the damage caused during sampling often impeded their identification. The specimens were also genetically analyzed using a fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene. Scanning Electron Microscope images of the key microstructural characters were made using selected specimens from CCZ as well as from the comparative material. <\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Result and discussion<\/jats:title><jats:p>One morphotype was identified as the known species <jats:italic>Ophiotholia supplicans<\/jats:italic> Lyman, 1880, while the second is new to science and is described in this paper. The umbrella spines and the arrangement of their articulations on the lateral arm plate, were selected as the most relevant morphological characters in the taxonomy of the genus <jats:italic>Ophiotholia<\/jats:italic> and a revised identification key of all characters from all known <jats:italic>Ophiotholia<\/jats:italic> species is provided as a table in the supplement material. The identification and description of such a little-known genus improves the evaluation of the biodiversity not only in the CCZ but also for the deep sea.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.3389\/fmars.2023.1056282","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,6]],"date-time":"2023-03-06T17:36:59Z","timestamp":1678124219000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3389\/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Ophiotholia (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea): A little-known deep-sea genus present in polymetallic nodule fields with the description of a new species","prefix":"10.3389","volume":"10","author":[{"given":"Angelina","family":"Eichsteller","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alexander","family":"Martynov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Timothy D.","family":"O\u2019Hara","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Magdalini","family":"Christodoulou","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tatiana","family":"Korshunova","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guadalupe","family":"Bribiesca-Contreras","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Pedro","family":"Martinez Arbizu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"30492","DOI":"10.1038\/srep30492","article-title":"First insights into the abundance and diversity of abyssal megafauna in a polymetallic-nodule region in the eastern Clarion-Clipperton Zone","volume":"6","author":"Amon","year":"2016","journal-title":"Sci.
