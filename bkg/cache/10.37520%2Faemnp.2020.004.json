All available faunistic data are summarized and presented in detail. DNA barcodes of the mtCOI (cytochrome c oxidase I) gene of the majority of recorded species were studied. Molecular data and morphology support the following two species, which are described here as new to science: Caryocolum procurvella sp. nov. and C. atrum sp. nov.
