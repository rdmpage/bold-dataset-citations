Achrocerides theorini (Aurvillius, 1891) was determined to be a widespread, forest-dwelling species which shows high levels of intraspecific variability in both the external and genital morphology. Examination of the holotype of Chrysopoloma flavoantennata Berio, 1937 revealed this to be a rare species of Achrocerides exhibiting a large body size, and a new combination is introduced thus: Achrocerides flavoantennata (Berio, 1937) comb. n. Finally, a new species is identified from the Central African Republic and is herein described: Achrocerides smithi sp. n. The adults and genitalia of all taxa are illustrated, and a distribution map provided to facilitate identification.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.37828\/em.2022.59.3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]],"date-time":"2022-11-28T18:53:45Z","timestamp":1669661625000},"page":"24-37","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Revision of Achrocerides Hering, 1937 (Lepidoptera: Chrysopolomidae)","prefix":"10.37828","volume":"59","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4001-9510","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Tabitha R.","family":"Taberer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2411-1701","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alessandro","family":"Giusti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"24704","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"container-title":"Ecologica Montenegrina","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/em\/article\/download\/78262\/74349","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/em\/article\/download\/78262\/74350","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/em\/article\/download\/78262\/74349","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]],"date-time":"2022-11-28T18:53:45Z","timestamp":1669661625000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.biotaxa.org\/em\/article\/view\/78262"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.37828\/em.2022.59.3","relation":{},"ISSN":["2336-9744","2337-0173"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"Ecol.
