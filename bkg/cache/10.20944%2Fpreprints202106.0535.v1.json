We applied protocols recently developed for the rapid assessment of most animal taxa inhabiting any freshwater system, by using light traps, and DNA barcodes, represented by the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI). We DNA barcoded 1037 specimens of mites, crustaceans, insects, and fish larvae from 13 aquatic environments close or inside the reserve, with a success rate of 99.8%. In total, 167 Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU&amp;rsquo;s) were detected. From them we identified 43 species. All others remain as a MOTU. For analyzing the adult fish communities, we applied the non-invasive method of environmental DNA (eDNA), and identified the sequences obtained with the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD). We found 25 fish species, and other terrestrial vertebrates from this region. No alien species was found. After a comparison of the MOTU&amp;rsquo;s from all systems, we found that each water body was unique respect the communities observed. The reference library presented here represents the first step for future programs to detect any change in these ecosystems, including invasive species, or improve knowledge of freshwater zooplankton, because most of the MOTU&amp;rsquo;s are possibly new species to science.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.20944\/preprints202106.0535.v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,23]],"date-time":"2021-06-23T10:37:31Z","timestamp":1624444651000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":"Dna Barcodes, a Powerful Tool for a Rapid Construction of a Baseline and Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems in Sian Ka\u2019an Reserve (Quintana Roo State, Mexico) And Adjacent Areas","prefix":"10.20944","author":[{"given":"Martha Valdez","family":"Moreno","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Manuel Mendoza","family":"Carranza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Eduardo","family":"Rend\u00f3n-Hern\u00e1ndez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Erika","family":"Alarc\u00f3n-Chavira","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2562-4584","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Manuel","family":"El\u00edas-Guti\u00e9rrez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","container-title":[],"original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,6]],"date-time":"2021-07-06T07:39:51Z","timestamp":1625557191000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.preprints.org\/manuscript\/202106.0535\/v1"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,22]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.20944\/preprints202106.0535.v1","relation":{"is-preprint-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.3390\/d13070292","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"subject":[],"published":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,22]]},"subtype":"preprint"}
