Among this material we found a single Platycheirus species of the manicatus subgroup and another species belonging to the peltatus subgroup. The molecular and morphological data suggest the presence of Platycheirus islandicus Ringdahl, 1930 as a non-migratory endemic species for Iceland and Platycheirus manicatus Meigen, 1822 as a migratory species with regular influx from mainland Europe. The DNA barcodes as well as morphological characters are given for both species. A discussion about colonisation, and related topics like the nunatak and tabula rasa hypotheses, and migration theory on the endemism in Iceland is given.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.55710\/1\/zjda1070","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,14]],"date-time":"2023-12-14T11:09:41Z","timestamp":1702552181000},"page":"1-22","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"Iceland, a mere remote island or a hoverfly (Diptera, Syrphidae) hotspot for endemism?
