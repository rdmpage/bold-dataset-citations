Museum specimens have the potential to address this gap, but the variation introduced by sampling and preservation methods is uncertain. This study quantifies species-level variation in the body mass of Canadian Coleoptera based on the analysis of 3,744 specimens representing 3,161 Barcode Index Number (BIN) clusters. Employing the BIN system as a proxy for species allows the inclusion of groups where the taxonomic impediment prevents the assignment of specimens to a Linnaean species. By validating the reproducibility of measurements and evaluating the error introduced by operational complexities such as curatorial practice and the loss of body parts, this study demonstrates that museum specimens can speed the assembly of a mass registry. The results further indicate that congeneric species of Coleoptera generally have limited variation in mass, so a genus-level identification allows prediction of the body mass of species that have not been weighed or measured. Building on the present results, the construction of a mass registry for all insects is feasible.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7717\/peerj.12799","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,21]],"date-time":"2022-01-21T08:25:52Z","timestamp":1642753552000},"page":"e12799","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Measuring
