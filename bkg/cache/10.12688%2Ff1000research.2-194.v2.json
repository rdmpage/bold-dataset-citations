However, those traps placed 20 meters high would have had to be lowered to the ground daily for checking and replacement of the dry ice, and that would give ticks a chance to crawl onto the traps out of their own volition. Ticks are attracted to carbon dioxide and fast crawling ticks like Amblyomma spp. can be collected in large numbers quite quickly. Unfed questing ticks that crawled onto and eventually into dry ice container(s) would be discovered the next day to cause a \u201csensational discovery\u201d. Uneven distribution and seasonal dynamics of ticks explain why some traps had ticks and others did not. Differences in placement of traps explain why only high-hanging traps caught ticks.&quot;<\/i>We appreciate the reviewer calling attention to our lack of detail about our field sampling practice. It is clear that the original draft of our manuscript was without sufficient detail to demonstrate that our finding is not likely to be the consequence of trap-handling artifacts. In fact, when we first found ticks on our traps, our team recognized the novelty of our finding and we took critical steps to ensure that the ticks originated in the canopy and were not accidentally sampled from the ground. We have added the following text to our manuscript:&quot;When our field team first discovered the presence of ticks on the outside of CDC-LTs, recognizing that this was a novel occurrence, we carefully reviewed and modified our field protocol to ensure that our observance of host-seeking ticks in the forest canopy was not an artifact of our field methods. To wit, each morning when the traps were lowered, field members, including the senior author, first checked carefully for the presence of ticks on the exterior of each CDC-LT. This was done while the trap was suspended. Any ticks were immediately removed and placed in ethanol and labeled with appropriate metadata (date, trap number, etc.). Subsequently, the netting containing mosquitoes was secured in a plastic box for processing in the indoor laboratory space of Barro Colorado Island. The umbrella and the cylinder containing the fan mechanism of each trap were also taken back to the lab, but the igloo cooler was sealed in a white garbage bag and re-suspended in the mid-canopy (free from by-passers and foliage) during the day. In the evening, CDC-LTs were carried pre-assembled in Rubbermaid-style plastic boxes to the field and were quickly re-assembled in each field site, with loading of the solid CO2 as the final step. At no time were either canopy or understory CDC-LTs placed on the ground while they were being serviced in the field.&quot;&nbsp;\n<i>&quot;The suppositions advanced in this account can only stem from ignorance regarding ticks, their biology, behavior, and even the standard terminology. It is usually advisable to consider simple explanations of unexpected results prior to making \u201castounding\u201d claims.&quot;<\/i>We would like to emphasize that the entire point of F1000Research observational articles is that they are precisely designed to document unexpected results that may improve our understanding of the natural world:\u201cScience\u2019s most important breakthroughs, from the discovery of microorganisms to the theory of evolution, have come about through observation. As part of the scientific method, observations are made to record a fact or an occurrence to help either prove or disprove a hypothesis. However, we all know the unpredictable nature of science and the curve balls it can throw\u201d (See more at: http:\/\/blog.f1000research.com\/2013\/09\/12\/the-observation-article-recording-phenomena-in-scientific-research\/#sthash.QP2xbUJj.dpuf )Our observations are robust and repeatable. As a research team working at one of the world\u2019s oldest tropical research institutions, we are acutely aware of just how much remains to be discovered in our tropical forests, especially in the extremely inaccessible tropical forest canopy. Given that nymphs and larvae of \n<i>A. tapirellum<\/i> typically cannot be identified to species in the field (e.g.&nbsp;Berm&uacute;dez et al. 2010), and that a Google Scholar search retrieves only 27 articles (including ours) when searching for \u201c\n<i>Amblyomma tapirellum<\/i>\u201d, certainly Dr. Levin is not suggesting that our scientific knowledge of the life history of this and other Neotropical ticks species is complete. Fortunately, third party teams are currently actively working in Panama to more fully document the frequency that host-seeking ticks exploit the tropical canopy and confirm our finding. We are grateful for the opportunity given to us by F1000Research to publish our observation that has encouraged those efforts.&nbsp;","URL":"https:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/2-194\/v2#referee-comment-674","order":3,"name":"referee-comment-674","label":"Referee Comment","group":{"name":"article-reports","label":"Article Reports"}},{"value":"10.5256\/f1000research.3706.r3387, Matias Pablo Juan Szab\u00f3, Institute of Biomedical Sciences and School of Veterinary Medicine, Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, Uberl\u00e2ndia, Brazil, 28 Feb 2014, version 2, indexed","URL":"https:\/\/f1000research.com\/articles\/2-194\/v2#referee-response-3387","order":4,"name":"referee-response-3387","label":"Referee Report","group":{"name":"article-reports","label":"Article Reports"}},{"value":"Financial support was provided by Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute \u2013 Environmental Protection Agency grant DW33-92296801-0 \u201cMosquito Species Diversity and Landscape Change\u201d to MJP and OIS; and the Secretariat for Science, Technology, and Innovation of Panama (SENACYT) \u2013 National Research Investigator award (SNI) granted to JRL.
