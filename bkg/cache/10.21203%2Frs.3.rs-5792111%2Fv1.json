Here we analyse a new global dataset of genomic DNA sequences, spanning an entire taxonomic class of benthic invertebrates (Ophiuroidea), to obtain a broad understanding of phylogenetic divergence and biotic movement across all oceans, from coastal margins down to the abyssal plains. We show that regional faunas on the continental shelf are phylogenetically divergent, particularly at temperate and tropical latitudes. In contrast, assemblages in the deep sea are much more connected. Many temperate deep-sea lineages have achieved distribution ranges across the planet, including over the Quaternary period. A close relationship exists between deep-sea faunas of the North Atlantic and Southern Australia, on the opposite sides of the globe. Bathymetric interchange is not only reliant on vertical migration through isothermal polar waters but also occurs across the thermal depth gradients of tropical regions. The connected nature of deep-sea life should be an important consideration in marine conservation assessments.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-5792111\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,23]],"date-time":"2025-01-23T04:31:33Z","timestamp":1737606693000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Spatiotemporal faunal connectivity across global seafloors","prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0885-6578","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Timothy","family":"O'Hara","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Museums Victoria"}]},{"given":"Andrew","family":"Hugall","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Museums Victoria"}]},{"given":"Margaret","family":"Haines","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Museums Victoria"}]},{"given":"Alexandra Anh-Thu","family":"Weber","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology"}]},{"given":"Angelina","family":"Eichsteller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Deutschen Zentrum f\u00fcr Marine Biodiversit\u00e4tsforschung"}]},{"given":"Martin","family":"Brogger","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Instituto de Biolog\u00eda de Organismos Marino\u2019s, IBIOMAR CONICET"}]},{"given":"Marc","family":"El\u00e9aume","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Mus\u00e9um national d\u2019Histoire naturelle"}]},{"given":"Toshihiko","family":"Fujita","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"National Museum of Nature and Science"}]},{"given":"Jon","family":"Kongsrud","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University Museum of Bergen"}]},{"given":"Pedro Martinez","family":"Arbizu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"German Centre for Marine Biodiversity Research"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8122-0456","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"V","family":"Mills","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research"}]},{"given":"Jennifer","family":"Olbers","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"WILDTRUST"}]},{"given":"Gustav","family":"Paulay","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Florida"}]},{"given":"Fran","family":"Ramil","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Mari\u00f1a, Facultade de Ciencias do Mar, Universidade de Vigo"}]},{"given":"Sarah","family":"Samadi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1028-0328","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Chester","family":"Sands","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"British Antarctic Survey"}]},{"given":"javier","family":"Sellanes","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Norte, Chile"}]},{"given":"Francisco","family":"Solis-Marin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}]},{"given":"Adnan","family":"Moussalli","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Museum Victoria"}]}],"member":"297","container-title":[],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-5792111\/v1","content-type":"text\/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-5792111\/v1.html","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,23]],"date-time":"2025-01-23T04:31:49Z","timestamp":1737606709000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-5792111\/v1"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,23]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.21203\/rs.3.rs-5792111\/v1","relation":{},"subject":[],"published":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,23]]},"subtype":"preprint"}
