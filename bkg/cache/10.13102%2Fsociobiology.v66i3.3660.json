We propose to raise A. subterranea var. ichnusa Santschi, 1925, described from Sardinia, to the species status, A. ichnusa Santschi, 1925 stat. nov. This species differs from A. subterranea by having shorter propodeal spines and a less sculptured cuticle. Phylogenetic reconstruction using the mitochondrial marker COI shows that the two species form well separated clades, with a genetic distance (K2p) of 9.8\u00a0%. In the studied area, the two species are parapatric, A. ichnusa occurring in Sardinia, Corsica and the Mediterranean area of continental France, and A. subterranea occurring North of this area. We propose a redescription of both species and designation of a neotype for A. subterranea.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.13102\/sociobiology.v66i3.3660","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]],"date-time":"2019-11-21T21:28:20Z","timestamp":1574371700000},"page":"420","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":"Aphaenogaster ichnusa Santschi, 1925, bona species, and Redescription of Aphaenogaster subterranea (Latreille, 1798) (Hymenoptera, Formicidae)","prefix":"10.13102","volume":"66","author":[{"given":"Christophe","family":"Galkowski","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Cl\u00e9ment","family":"Aubert","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rumsais","family":"Blatrix","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"5255","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,14]]},"container-title":"Sociobiology","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/index.php\/sociobiology\/article\/viewFile\/3660\/4004","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/index.php\/sociobiology\/article\/viewFile\/3660\/4004","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,21]],"date-time":"2019-11-21T21:28:22Z","timestamp":1574371702000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/periodicos.uefs.br\/index.php\/sociobiology\/article\/view\/3660"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,14]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,14]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.13102\/sociobiology.v66i3.3660","relation":{},"ISSN":["2447-8067","0361-6525"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"Sociobiology","published":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,14]]}}
