This study examines marine refugial locations during the Last Glacial Maximum in order to link recolonization pathways to patterns of genetic diversity in Arctic marine forests. We present genetic data for 109 species of seaweed to infer community-level patterns, and hindcast species distributions during the Last Glacial Maximum to further pinpoint likely refugial locations. Sequence data revealed contiguous populations extending from the Bering Sea to the Northwest Atlantic, with high levels of genetic diversity in the East Canadian Arctic. One fifth of the species sampled appeared restricted to Arctic waters. Hindcasted species distributions highlighted refugia in the Bering Sea, Northwest Atlantic, South Greenland, and Europe. We hypothesize that Arctic coastal systems were recolonized from many geographically disparate refugia leading to enriched diversity levels in the East Canadian Arctic, with important contributions stemming from northerly refugia likely centered along Southern Greenland. Moreover, we hypothesize these northerly refugia likely played a key role in promoting polar endemic diversity, as reflected by abundant unique population haplotypes and endemic species in the East Arctic.<\/jats:p><jats:sec><jats:title>Significance Statement<\/jats:title><jats:p>Our work challenges the existing paradigm that marine Arctic ecosystems are depauperate extensions of southerly (temperate) communities established in the wake of recent glaciation, fundamentally changing how these systems should be viewed and interpreted. We forward novel hypotheses regarding the recent history of Arctic marine systems, particularly with regards to endemism being an integral feature of Arctic biomes, and present a firm framework for future evolutionary research in this system typically viewed as \u201cecologically immature.\u201d<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1101\/2020.03.19.999466","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,20]],"date-time":"2020-03-20T13:15:33Z","timestamp":1584710133000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Population structure in Arctic marine forests is shaped by diverse recolonisation pathways and far northern glacial refugia","prefix":"10.1101","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5976-6700","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Trevor T.","family":"Bringloe","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Heroen","family":"Verbruggen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Gary W.","family":"Saunders","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"246","reference":[{"key":"2024080400333217000_2020.03.19.999466v2.1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1679","DOI":"10.1016\/j.quascirev.2010.03.001","article-title":"Temperature and precipitation history of the Arctic","volume":"29","year":"2010","journal-title":"Quaternary Sciences Reviews"},{"key":"2024080400333217000_2020.03.19.999466v2.2","first-page":"e55","article-title":"Projected climate changes threaten ancient refugia of kelp forests in the North Atlantic","volume":"24","year":"2018","journal-title":"Glob.
