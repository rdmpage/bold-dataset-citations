Analysis of <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> sequences of 12 samples collected from different manatees captured in three areas of Florida indicated that they represented a single undescribed species within the Rhodomelaceae genus <jats:italic>Melanothamnus<\/jats:italic>. Morphological analysis revealed <jats:italic>Melanothamnus<\/jats:italic> characteristics but also a previously undescribed combination of character states. These include eight to nine, but as many as 11, pericentral cells; heavy cortication restricted to the base of thalli, and a sharp transition between the corticated and ecorticate sections of the thallus; cells surrounding the ostiole being similar in size to the outer pericarp cells immediately below, and robust rhizoids that have no terminal lobes and develop from central axial cell filaments instead of pericentral cells. The unique characteristics of the rhizoids may be evolutionary adaptations for anchoring the thalli to manatee epidermis. This species is described as <jats:italic>M. maniticola<\/jats:italic> sp. nov.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1111\/jpy.12912","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,10]],"date-time":"2019-08-10T12:14:53Z","timestamp":1565439293000},"page":"1239-1245","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":"<i>Melanothamnus maniticola<\/i> sp. nov.
