Peatlands are widespread around the world, with several highly paludified regions, one of which is the Western Siberian Plain. Peatlands store large amounts of carbon and are important in their intact state to counteract climate change, as well as for a variety of other ecosystem functions. From the practical aspect, these ecosystems are used as a source of peat for fuel, peat-based fertilisers and growing media, berries and <jats:italic>Sphagnum<\/jats:italic> plantations. Fungi are the key part of the decomposer community of peatlands, playing a critical role in the aerobic decomposition in the upper peat layer. The community of peatland fungi is adapted to decomposition of peat and dead parts of <jats:italic>Sphagnum<\/jats:italic> in wet acidic conditions; they form specific mycorrhizal associations with a variety of plants. Thus, the research of fungal diversity of peatlands is important for several reasons: 1) adding knowledge of peatland fungal diversity to local or global biodiversity databases; 2) studying carbon cycling in peatlands; 3) using peat and peatlands for different applications, such as cultivation of <jats:italic>Sphagnum<\/jats:italic> with regards to some parasitic species of fungi and 4) peatland restoration and conservation, to mention a few.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The community of macromycetes of the raised bog \u201cMukhrino\u201d in Western Siberia was studied using plot-based monitoring throughout a 9-year observation period. The revealed species diversity is represented by approximately 500 specimens in the Fungarium of Yugra State University collection. Selected specimens were used for barcoding of the ITS region to reveal a total of 95 species from 33 genera and three classes. The barcoding effort confirmed morphological identifications for most specimens and identified a number of cryptic species and several potentially new taxa. Based on regular all-season observations, we describe the phenology of the community sporophore production. The quantitative community structure, based on sporophores, revealed a difference in abundance between species by four orders of magnitude, with rare species representing nearly half of the species list. The inter-annual fruiting abundance varied several times by the total number of sporophores per year. To make the comparisons with global studies, we created an open access database of literature-based observations of fungi in peatlands, based on about 120 published papers (comprising about 1300 species) and compared our species list with this database.<\/jats:p>\n          <jats:p>As a result, the study created an accurate representation of taxonomic and quantitative structure of the community of macromycetes in raised bogs in the region. The raw data of plot-based counts was published as a sampling-event dataset and the sequenced specimens with the sequence information as an DNA-derived extension dataset in GBIF.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3897\/bdj.11.e105111","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]],"date-time":"2023-10-20T07:45:13Z","timestamp":1697787913000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"The diversity of macromycetes in peatlands: nine years of plot-based monitoring and barcoding in the raised bog \"Mukhrino\", West Siberia","prefix":"10.3897","volume":"11","author":[{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9506-0991","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Nina","family":"Filippova","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2063-4847","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Elena","family":"Zvyagina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Elena","family":"Rudykina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alevtina","family":"Dobrynina","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6208-7792","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Sergey","family":"Bolshakov","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"2258","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,20]]},"reference":[{"key":"105111_B9222149","author":"Arnolds","year":"1981","journal-title":"Ecology and coenology of macrofungi in grasslands and moist heathlands in Drenthe, the Netherlands"},{"key":"105111_B9222204","volume":"IV","author":"Arnolds","year":"2007","journal-title":"Environmental and microbial relationships: The mycota"},{"key":"105111_B9221084","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1029\/2008gm000806"},{"key":"105111_B9719448","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.21638\/spbu03.2021.404"},{"key":"105111_B9222175","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/gcb.12263"},{"key":"105111_B9222238","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/1440-1703.12102"},{"key":"105111_B9222254","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/2041-210x.13682"},{"key":"105111_B9221298","first-page":"161","article-title":"Makromitsety i ikh rol' v dinamike rastitel'nosti pri osushenii [The mycoflora of oligotrophic bogs and paludified forests and its role in the the dynamics of plant associations in the course of drainage.
