During this study comprehensive analysis on aggressive behavior in Acheta domesticus (Linnaeus) was investigated. It was noticed that male adopted six behavioral responses i.e., pre-established dominance, antennal railing, uni-lateral and bi-lateral mandible dispersal, engagement of mandibles and grappling in order to gain contact to females and to defend his territory was significantly prominent. This aggressive behavior was ignored yet attention was not paid towards this. Beside this, Illustrative Barcode, Nucleotide Sequence, Sequences producing significant alignment, and Distance distribution graph of Acheta domesticus was also presented for correct identification of sibling species.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.38211\/joarps.2022.3.2.41","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,12]],"date-time":"2022-11-12T07:18:25Z","timestamp":1668237505000},"page":"341-347","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Aggressive Behavior and DNA Sequencing of Acheta Domesticus (Gryllidae: Orthoptera)","prefix":"10.38211","volume":"3","author":[{"given":"Ambreen","family":"Afghan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"http:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4775-8452","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Riffat","family":"Sultana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Naheed","family":"Baloch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"25383","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,12]]},"reference":[{"key":"1860","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Alexander, R.
