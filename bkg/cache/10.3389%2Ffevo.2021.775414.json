The population diversity and genetic structure of SFB are unknown. Here, we assembled a draft genome for the SFB and characterized the distribution of microsatellites. Then, we developed 12 novel microsatellite markers across the genome. We used a segment of the <jats:italic>cox1<\/jats:italic> gene and newly developed microsatellite markers to genotype the genetic diversity of SFB across southern China. There were 44 mitochondrial haplotypes in the SFB populations, with haplotype 2 as the most widespread. The population genetic differentiation was very low, indicated by <jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub>-values (&amp;lt;0.05 except for Guangxi population with other populations based on <jats:italic>cox1<\/jats:italic>), high gene flow (4.10 and 44.88 of <jats:italic>cox1<\/jats:italic> and microsatellite, respectively) and Principal Coordinate Analysis across all populations. Mantel test showed genetic distance in SFB was significantly associated with geographic distance based on microsatellites (<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> = 0.2373, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> = 0.014) while result based on <jats:italic>cox1<\/jats:italic> (<jats:italic>R<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> = 0.0365, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> = 0.155) showed no significant difference. The phylogenetic analysis did not find any geographically related clades among all haplotypes. Analyses based on microsatellites showed a lack of population genetic structure among all populations. Our study provides a foundation for the future understanding of the ecology and evolution of SFB and its management.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389\/fevo.2021.775414","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,3]],"date-time":"2022-02-03T12:39:16Z","timestamp":1643891956000},"update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.3389\/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":"Lack of Genetic Structure Among Populations of Striped Flea Beetle Phyllotreta striolata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) Across Southern China","prefix":"10.3389","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"Qian","family":"Li","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Guang-Mei","family":"Li","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yong-Li","family":"Zheng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shu-Jun","family":"Wei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,3]]},"reference":[{"key":"B1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"803","DOI":"10.1603\/0022-0493-99.3.803","article-title":"Alternative management tactics for control of Phyllotreta cruciferae and Phyllotreta striolata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) on Brassica rapa in Massachusetts.","volume":"99","author":"Andersen","year":"2006","journal-title":"J.
