Altogether 564 species of butterfly were recorded from the research area, with 450 species from the Wologizi Mountains, 254 from the Wonegizi Mountains and 429 from the Ziama Massif. An additional five species recorded in Ziama were added to the list as literature data. The surveys revealed several taxa new to science as well as a high number of restricted-range species, endemic either to the Guinea Highlands or to the broader forest area of the Liberian subregion. The results of the ecological classification of the butterfly fauna in Ziama and Wologizi show intact forest fauna with 90% and 92% of the recorded species associated with forest habitats, respectively. These results, along with the high species richness and the outstanding number of restricted-range species, make this landscape one of the most important conservation areas for butterflies in the Liberian biogeographical subregion including the Nimba Mountains and the Greater Gola Landscape on the Liberia-Sierra Leone border.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.4314\/met.v31i1.21","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,17]],"date-time":"2022-03-17T10:49:11Z","timestamp":1647514151000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":"Butterfly diversity (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) in the Ziama Massif in Guinea and  the adjacent Wonegizi and Wologizi Mountains in Liberia (West Africa): A  transboundary conservation approach","prefix":"10.4314","volume":"31","author":[{"given":"Szabolcs","family":"S\u00e1fi\u00e1n","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"S\u00e9ma","family":"Ko\u0457vogui","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"G\u00e1bor","family":"Simonics","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Klaudia J.","family":"Florczyk","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"2895","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,16]]},"container-title":"Metamorphosis","original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.ajol.info\/index.php\/met\/article\/download\/222900\/210273","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.ajol.info\/index.php\/met\/article\/download\/222900\/210273","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,17]],"date-time":"2022-03-17T10:49:18Z","timestamp":1647514158000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.ajol.info\/index.php\/met\/article\/view\/222900"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,16]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,16]]}},"URL":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.4314\/met.v31i1.21","relation":{},"ISSN":["2307-5031"],"subject":[],"container-title-short":"met","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,16]]}}
