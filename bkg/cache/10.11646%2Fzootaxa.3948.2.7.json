The analysis reported here included both DNA barcodes and morphology. Only two species were validated: G. viridis (Fabricius 1780) and G. hemifasciatus Andriashev 1937. The latter species occurred as two morphotypes for which there is some evidence of difference in ecological preference, but the available environ-mental data are not robust enough to firmly identify or verify ecophenotypes.\u00a0<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.11646\/zootaxa.3948.2.7","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,4,21]],"date-time":"2015-04-21T01:21:09Z","timestamp":1429579269000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":"Reassessment of multiple species of Gymnelus (Teleostei: Zoarcidae) in Pacific Arctic and boreal regions","prefix":"10.11646","volume":"3948","author":[{"given":"CATHERINE W.","family":"MECKLENBURG","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"M.
